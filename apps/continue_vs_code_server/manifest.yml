  [Continue] is a AI code assistant. It allows us to connect Large Language Models (LLMs) to our 
  [Code-Server] session, which allows for custom autocomplete and chat experiences inside the 
  [VS Code] IDE. To allow for easy integration of LLMs we host an [Ollama] server. This server 
  currently has the following LLMs available:       

  * [llama3] 8b model
      * For conversational tasks 
  * [deepseek-coder-v2] 16b model
      * For code specific tasks
  * [starcoder2] 3b model 
      * For code completion
