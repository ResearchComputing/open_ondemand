# RStudio Session Application 

The provided Jupyter Session elements were modified and initially inspired by 
[OSC's Code Server setup.](https://github.com/OSC/bc_osc_rstudio_server). We appreciate 
all of the hard work this team has done. Without them, creating apps such as this 
would not be possible! 

## How does it work?

This app launches an RStudio Server using an Apptainer image that is based off of the Docker Hub image [rocker/rstudio](https://hub.docker.com/r/rocker/rstudio). Once this server is started, we connect to it.
