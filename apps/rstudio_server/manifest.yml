  This app will launch [RStudio Server](https://rstudio.com), an IDE for [R](https://www.r-project.org) 
  on Alpine.

  <mark style="background-color: #FFF36D"> 
  Before utilizing this application, please see the [RStudio Server](https://curc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/open_ondemand/rstudio.html)
  and [Configuring Open OnDemand interactive applications](https://curc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/open_ondemand/configuring_apps.html) 
  sections in our documentation. This documentation includes important information regarding quitting an 
  RStudio session. For more information on installing dependencies required by R packages, 
  please see the [Installing dependencies for RStudio Server](https://curc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/open_ondemand/rstudio.html#installing-dependencies-for-rstudio-server) 
  section in our documentation.

  Please note that the first time you launch RStudio it may take 15 minutes or more to create a 
  [persistent overlay]( https://apptainer.org/docs/user/main/persistent_overlays.html), if 1 core 
  is used. For this reason, we recommend using 4 cores or more during your first launch of an 
  RStudio session. Subsequent sessions will not require the creation of the persistent overlay; 
  therefore 1 core may be sufficient.
