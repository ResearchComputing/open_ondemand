  This app will launch [RStudio Server](https://rstudio.com), an IDE for [R](https://www.r-project.org) on Alpine.

  <mark style="background-color: #FFF36D"> Before utilizing this application, please see the [RStudio section of the CURC documentation](https://curc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/gateways/OnDemand.html#rstudio). This documentation includes important information regarding quitting an RStudio session. For more information on installing dependencies required by R packages, please see the [Installing dependencies for RStudio](https://curc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/gateways/OnDemand.html#installing-dependencies-for-rstudio-currently-available-only-on-alpine) section in our documentation. </mark>

  <mark style="background-color: #FF5631"> Please note that the first time you launch RStudio it may take 15 minutes or more to create a [persistent overlay]( https://apptainer.org/docs/user/main/persistent_overlays.html), if 1 core is used. For this reason, we recommend using 4 cores or more during your first launch of an RStudio session.  Subsequent sessions will not require the creation of the persistent overlay; therefore 1 core may be sufficient. </mark>
