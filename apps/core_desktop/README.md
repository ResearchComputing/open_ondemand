# Core Desktop Application 

The provided Core Desktop elements were modified and initially inspired by 
[OSC's Desktop setup.](https://github.com/OSC/ondemand/tree/master/apps/bc_desktop). We appreciate 
all of the hard work this team has done. Without them, creating apps such as this 
would not be possible! 

## How does it work?

This app launches a remote desktop session.
