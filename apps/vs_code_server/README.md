# VS Code Server Application 

The provided Jupyter Session elements were modified and initially inspired by 
[OSC's Code Server setup.](https://github.com/OSC/bc_osc_codeserver). We appreciate 
all of the hard work this team has done. Without them, creating apps such as this 
would not be possible! 

## How does it work?

This app launches a VS Code Server using a precompiled binary for Code Server. Once this server is started, we connect to it.
