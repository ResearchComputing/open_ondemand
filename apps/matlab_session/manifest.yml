  This app will launch a MATLAB GUI on a visualization node. You will be
  able to interact with MATLAB through a VNC session. For more information 
  on this application, please see our [MATLAB GUI](https://curc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/open_ondemand/matlab.html) documentation.

  GPU based options are not meant for computationally intensive workflows. Additionally, 
  please keep in mind that these GPU based options are a shared 
  resource amongst all users. Thus, significant computation by one 
  user can affect other users of this service.
