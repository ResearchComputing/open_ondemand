  This app will launch a MATLAB GUI on a CURC node. You will be
  able to interact with MATLAB through a VNC session. <mark style="background-color: #FFF36D"> 
  GPU based options are not meant for computationally intensive workflows. Additionally, 
  please keep in mind that these GPU based options are a shared 
  resource amongst all users. Thus, significant computation by one 
  user can affect other users of this service.
