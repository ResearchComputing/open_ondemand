# MATLAB Application 

The provided MATLAB Session elements were modified and initially inspired by 
[OSC's MATLAB setup.](https://github.com/OSC/bc_osc_matlab). We appreciate 
all of the hard work this team has done. Without them, creating apps such as this 
would not be possible! 

## How does it work?

This app launches a remote desktop session and then launches MATLAB.
