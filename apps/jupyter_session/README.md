# Jupyter Session Application 

The provided Jupyter Session elements were modified and initially inspired by 
[OSC's Code Server setup.](https://github.com/OSC/bc_osc_jupyter). We appreciate 
all of the hard work this team has done. Without them, creating apps such as this 
would not be possible! 

## How does it work?

This app launches an Jupyter session using using the Jupyter CLI provided by either Jupyter Lab or Jupyter Notebook. Once this server is started, we connect to it.
