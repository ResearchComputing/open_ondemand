# ICS Desktop Application 

The provided Core Desktop elements were modified and initially inspired by 
[OSC's Desktop setup.](https://github.com/OSC/ondemand/tree/master/apps/bc_desktop). We appreciate 
all of the hard work this team has done. Without them, creating apps such as this 
would not be possible! This particular application was created specifically for the 
ICS group it opens a core desktop on the groups blogin-ics2 node. Only individuals who 
are part of the icsgrp can access this application. 

## How does it work?

This app launches a remote desktop session.
